    * At the start of the game, let the user know how many
      letters the secretWord contains.

    * Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.

    * The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess
      about whether their guess appears in the computers word.

    * After each round, you should also display to the user the
      partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the
      user has not yet guessed.
