# Readme
This repository contains the demos and code used at the IOS XE Programmability demo booth at Cisco Live Vegas 2017. Thanks for stopping by to see us and test driving IOS XE APIs. In addition to the code from the demos there are a number of other resources to help as you get started with automation and programmability (see below).

### Learning

1. [Programming the Digital Network Architecture](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/programming-dna) (DNA)

	Dive in and learn all you need to know to work with the APIs and interfaces in the Digital Network Architecture. Explore programming foundations and APIs. Learn about APIC-EM, as well as device level APIs provided by YANG Data Models such as NETCONF and RESTCONF!

### GitHub Repo's

1. [Cisco YANG Models for IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX OS](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco)

	Cisco GitHub repository that has YANG models for each OS organized by release.

1. [OpenConfig YANG Models](https://github.com/openconfig/public/tree/master/release/models)

	Repository of OpenConfig YANG models.

1. [DevNet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet)

	Cisco GitHub repository providing you with sample code to help you get started.

### Tools

1. [Yang Developer Kit (YDK)](http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs/)

	A Software Development Kit that provides APIâ€™s that are modeled in YANG.

1. [Yang Explorer](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yang-explorer)

	An open-source YANG Browser and RPC Builder Application to experiment with Yang Data Models

1. [Pyang](https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang)

	A YANG validator, transformer and code generator, written in python. It can be used to validate YANG modules for correctness, to transform YANG modules into other formats, and to generate code from the modules.

1. [IOS XE Programmability Sandbox - 16.6 Early Demo Code](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/7fd27b24-7034-477d-9ad2-e2c8096dd1a5?diagramType=Topology)

	Test drive the latest programmability capabilities like Guest Shell, Python, ZTP, and RESTconf in this IOS XE based Sandbox providing access to early demo code!
