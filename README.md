# Readme
This repository contains the demos and code used at the IOS XE Programmability demo booth at Cisco Live Vegas 2017. Thanks for stopping by to see us and test driving IOS XE APIs. In addition to the code from the demos there are a number of other resources to help as you get started with automation and programmability (see below).

If you are brand new to network automation and device APIs, the best place to get started are the DevNet Learning Labs. In particular we recommend you start with the [Programming the Digital Network Architecture](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/programming-dna "Programming the Digital Network Architecture") (DNA)_learning track.


### DevNet

1. [IOS XE DevNet Site](https://developer.cisco.com/site/ios-xe/)
	
	The DevNet site for various resources regarding network automation and device programmability on IOS XE

1. [IOS XE Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/site/ios-xe/docs/)

	Documentation about model driven programmability, streaming telemetry, network programmability with Python, configuration management, day zero provisioning, and developer tooling. 

### GitHub Repo's

1. [Cisco YANG Models for IOS XE, IOS XR, and NX OS](https://github.com/YangModels/yang/tree/master/vendor/cisco)

	Cisco GitHub repository that has YANG models for each OS organized by release.

1. [OpenConfig YANG Models](https://github.com/openconfig/public/tree/master/release/models)

	Repository of OpenConfig YANG models.

1. [DevNet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet)

	Cisco GitHub repository providing you with sample code to help you get started.

### Tools

1. [Yang Developer Kit (YDK)](http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs/)

	A Software Development Kit that provides APIâ€™s that are modeled in YANG.

1. [Yang Explorer](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yang-explorer)

	An open-source YANG Browser and RPC Builder Application to experiment with Yang Data Models

1. [NCClient Python Library](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)

	ncclient is a Python library that facilitates client-side scripting and application development around the NETCONF protocol. For help on how to get started using ncclient check out the [NCC DevNet GitHub](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ncc) repo for Python code examples.

1. [IOS XE Programmability Sandbox - 16.6 Early Demo Code](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/7fd27b24-7034-477d-9ad2-e2c8096dd1a5?diagramType=Topology)

	Test drive the latest programmability capabilities like Guest Shell, Python, ZTP, and RESTconf in this IOS XE based Sandbox providing access to early demo code!

1. [Pyang](https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang)

	A YANG validator, transformer and code generator, written in python. It can be used to validate YANG modules for correctness, to transform YANG modules into other formats, and to generate code from the modules.

### Community

1. [Developer Community](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/odp)

	This is the developer community where you can post questions and find content regarding network automation and device APIs.
