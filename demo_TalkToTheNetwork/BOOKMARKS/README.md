**BOOKMARKS** -- This folder is a collection of bookmarks to show folks the REST (or
Flask) equivalent of what Flask-Ask is doing with Alexa. It's really easy, and
for a code writer, might want to start with Flask before going to Flask-Ask.
Either way, you can import the bookmarks into your own browser, and just show
some data if you want .. if you're tied of asking Alexa.
