**CODE** -- This is the code. There are 2 files in here. One file called
"common_funcs.py" is the file that does the heavy-lifting for our Alexa app. It
technically creates all the function calls through RESTCONF. The file called
"iosrest.py" is our Alexa app. It's essentially really easy flask-ask defining
intents and asking for output!
