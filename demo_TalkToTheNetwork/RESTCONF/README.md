**RESTCONF** -- This folder contains the actual instructions sent to Alexa when you
play. This is always good to show first thing. You can set the stage for the
demo. I exported these RESTCONF calls for you to be run in POSTMAN. They should
work for you out of the box. Don't modify them! You can create some of your own,
but of course .. take care and don't mess things up too much.
